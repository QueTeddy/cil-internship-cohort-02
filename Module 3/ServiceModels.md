# Cloud Service Providers

Cloud service providers are companies that establish public clouds, manage private clouds, or offer on-demand cloud computing components (also known as cloud computing services) like Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service(SaaS).

## Service Models

**Software as a Service (SaaS):** This is a cloud-based service where instead of downloading software your desktop PC or business network to run and update, you instead access an application via an internet browser. The software application could be anything from office software to unified communications among a wide range of other business apps that are available. This offers a variety of advantages and disadvantages. Key advantages of SaaS includes accessibility, compatibility, and operational management. Additionally, SaaS models offer lower upfront costs than traditional software download and installation, making them more available to a wider range of businesses, making it easier for smaller companies to disrupt existing markets while empowering suppliers. SaaS are created with end users in mind to make use of.

Software-as-a-service is the most suitable when:

* You are a startup that needs to launch an e-commerce project quickly.
* You have little time to deal with server issues.
* You will use the app off and on.
* You are working on a short-term project that requires fast collaboration.
* Your application needs both web and mobile access.

**Examples:** Google Docs, Salesfoorce, Dropbox, Slack and Google Drive.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Platform-as-a-Service extends Software as a service model much further. The tools needed to create and deploy applications, it concept was to provide help to companies so they could focus on software development or providing other services to customers without having to manage, update, and maintain the actual platform that hosts the application. They are mostly used by developers.

Platform-as-a-service is the most suitable when:

* You are engaged in custom software development.
* You adopt the Agile Methodology. PaaS can solve issues related to rapid development and deployment.
* Your company develops mobile applications. With PaaS flexible solutions, you can build cross-platform applications. They will be adapted for any device and operating system.

**Examples:** Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Github, Docker, Windows Azure.

**Infastructure as a Service (IaaS):** IaaS gives users cloud-based alternatives to on-premise infrastructure, so businesses can avoid investing in expensive on-site resources. It is a self-service that gives users the opportunity to access and monitor hardware. It may include specialized processors, storage space, visualization services.

Infastructure-as-a-service is the most suitable when:

* You are a startup that lacks the funds required for creating your infrastructure.
* Infrastructure-as-a-service is noted for its ability to cope with large workloads so it helps when using big data.
* Your company is experiencing rapid growth. With IaaS solutions, you can easily change particular hardware or software according to your evolving needs.
* You do not have precise requirements for your application. IaaS is noted for its flexibility and scalability.

**Examples:** AWS Elastic Compute (EC2), VM Ware, DigitalOcean, Openstack, RockSpace.

| On Premises   | IAAS  | PAAS  | SAAS  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Application  | Application  |  Application | **Application**  |
| Data  | Data  | Data  | **Data**  |
| Runtime  | Runtime  | **Runtime**  |  **Runtime** |
| Middleware  | Middleware  | **Middleware**  |  **Middleware** |
| Operating System  | Operating System  |  **Operating System** |  **Operating System** |
|  Virtualization |  **Virtualization** |  **Virtualization** | **Virtualization**  |
| Servers |  **Servers** | **Servers**  |  **Servers** |
| Storage  |  **Storage** | **Storage**  | **Storage**  |
| Networking  |  **Networking** |  **Networking** |  **Networking** |
